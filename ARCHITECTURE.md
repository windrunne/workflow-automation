# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The Workflow Automation Builder is a React-based application that provides a visual interface for creating and managing workflow automation. The system is designed with modularity, type safety, and extensibility in mind.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Type Safety First
- Full TypeScript coverage with strict compiler settings
- Discriminated unions for step types ensuring compile-time safety
- Generic components with proper type constraints

### 2. Unidirectional Data Flow
- Redux Toolkit for predictable state management
- Actions flow downward, events bubble upward
- Clear separation between UI state and business logic

### 3. Component Composition
- Small, focused components with single responsibilities
- Higher-order components for cross-cutting concerns
- Custom hooks for shared business logic

### 4. Extensibility
- Plugin-ready architecture for custom step types
- Configurable step metadata system
- Modular component structure

## State Architecture

### Redux Store Structure
```typescript
{
  workflow: {
    currentWorkflow: Workflow | null,
    workflows: Workflow[],
    ui: WorkflowUIState,
    isLoading: boolean,
    error: string | null
  }
}
```

### Data Flow Patterns
1. **Component → Action → Reducer → Store → Component**
2. **User Interaction → Dispatch → State Update → Re-render**
3. **localStorage Sync → Store Hydration → UI Update**

## Component Hierarchy

```
Layout (Redux Provider)
├── Header (Workflow Management)
├── WorkflowSidebar (Component Library)
├── WorkflowCanvas (React Flow)
│   ├── CustomNode (Step Representation)
│   ├── MiniMap (Navigation)
│   └── Controls (Zoom/Pan)
└── ConfigPanel (Step Configuration)
```

## Step Type System

### Base Interface
```typescript
interface BaseStepConfig {
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  enabled: boolean;
  timeout?: number;
}
```

### Type Discrimination
Each step type extends the base with specific configuration:
- `SourceStepConfig` - Input configurations
- `ProcessingStepConfig` - Transformation settings  
- `DecisionStepConfig` - Conditional logic
- `OutputStepConfig` - Output formatting

### Step Registration
Steps are registered in `workflowSteps.ts` with metadata for UI rendering:
```typescript
{
  type: WorkflowStepType,
  subtype: string,
  label: string,
  description: string,
  icon: string,
  color: string,
  category: string
}
```

## Data Persistence Strategy

### localStorage Implementation
- Automatic serialization of workflow state
- Date object handling for proper JSON storage
- Incremental saves on state changes
- Export/Import functionality for portability

### Schema Evolution
- Version tracking for backward compatibility
- Migration functions for schema updates
- Graceful degradation for unknown step types

## Performance Considerations

### React Flow Optimizations
- Virtual rendering for large workflows
- Selective re-rendering of nodes
- Optimized edge calculations
- Memory-efficient node positioning

### State Optimizations
- Normalized state structure
- Memoized selectors for derived data
- Batched updates for related changes
- Debounced persistence operations

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security
- Input sanitization for user-provided scripts
- XSS prevention in dynamic content
- Safe JSON parsing with error handling
- Validation of imported workflow data

### Future API Considerations
- JWT token management
- CSRF protection
- API rate limiting
- Encrypted sensitive data

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Component isolation with mocking
- Redux reducer pure function testing
- Utility function validation
- Type-safe test utilities

### Integration Testing
- Workflow creation end-to-end
- State persistence validation
- Component interaction testing
- Error boundary verification

## Error Handling

### Error Boundaries
- Component-level error isolation
- Graceful degradation for failures
- Error reporting and logging
- Recovery mechanisms

### Validation System
- Step configuration validation
- Workflow structure validation
- Runtime error handling
- User feedback mechanisms

## Accessibility

### WCAG Compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast requirements
- Focus management

### Usability Features
- Drag-and-drop accessibility
- Alternative input methods
- Error message clarity
- Progressive disclosure

## Development Workflow

### Code Organization
- Feature-based folder structure
- Consistent naming conventions
- Import/export conventions
- Documentation standards

### Build Pipeline
- TypeScript compilation
- Tailwind CSS processing
- Asset optimization
- Bundle splitting

## Future Extensibility

### Plugin System Design
- Step type registration system
- Custom component injection
- Theme customization
- Configuration extensions

### API Integration Points
- Authentication providers
- External service connectors
- Webhook management
- Real-time collaboration

## Deployment Architecture

### Static Hosting
